      * Hormonal anticonception (birth control pills, spiral, depot injection with gestagen, subdermal implantation, hormonal vaginal ring, and transdermal depot patch)
      * Intrauterine device
      * Surgical sterilization
      * Surgical sterilization of male partner with verification of no sperm after the procedure
      * Menopause (for more than 12 months)
