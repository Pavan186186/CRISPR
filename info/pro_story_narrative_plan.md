## 🎬 OPENING HOOK: The Human Story
**Duration**: 1 minute  
**Layout**: Full-screen text, dark background with subtle particle effects  
**No visualization yet - pure storytelling**

### Content Sequence:

**Screen 1** (fade in slowly):
```
Every 13 seconds...
```
*(pause)*

**Screen 2** (fade in):
```
A sickle cell patient experiences a pain crisis.

Sharp.
Unbearable.
Unending.
```

**Screen 3** (builds line by line):
```
Imagine 30 years of this.

Monthly blood transfusions.
Unable to work.
Unable to play with your children.
Unable to live.

This was real for thousands.
```

**Screen 4** (larger text, golden glow):
```
Until 2019.

When everything changed.
```

**Screen 5** (question appears, centered):
```
What if I told you...

That what was "incurable" for decades...
Could be cured in a single treatment?

That children born with genetic death sentences...
Could live full, healthy lives?

That humanity found a way to rewrite our genetic code...
And fix what evolution got wrong?
```

**Screen 6** (powerful statement):
```
This isn't science fiction.

This is CRISPR.

And this is the story of how 
one discovery became a global revolution.
```

**Transition**: Particles coalesce into first visualization

2. It WORKS (Phase 2)  
3. It's READY (Phase 3)

Let's follow the journey.
```

**Phase Breakdowns** (appear as user views flows):
```
📍 PHASE 1: Proving Safety
Testing on small groups
Is it safe for humans?
Can we control the dose?

→ 280 trials started here
```

```
📍 PHASE 2: Proving Efficacy
Larger patient groups
Does it actually work?
What are the side effects?

→ 200 trials reached this stage
```

```
📍 PHASE 3: Final Validation
Large-scale testing
Ready for the real world?
Does it beat current treatments?

→ 87 trials made it here
```

### HIGHLIGHTED SUCCESS PATH (golden box):
```
⭐ THE GOLDEN PATH ⭐

CASGEVY (CTX001)
Sickle Cell Disease & Beta-Thalassemia

Phase 1 (2018) → Proven safe ✓
Phase 2 (2019) → Proven effective ✓  
Phase 3 (2021) → Ready for market ✓
FDA APPROVAL (December 2023) 🎉

From lab → Approved in 5 years

This isn't the only one.
It's the FIRST.
```

### STATISTICS PANEL (right):
```
📊 THE PIPELINE

Currently in Phase 3: 87 trials
Estimated for FDA review (2024-2026): 15 therapies

Diseases in Phase 3:
• Cancer (various types): 35 trials
• Blood disorders: 18 trials
• Eye diseases: 12 trials  
• Genetic conditions: 22 trials

These aren't "maybes."
These are "coming soon."
```

### CRITICAL INSIGHT BOX:
```
💡 WHY THIS MATTERS

Phase 3 trials don't happen by accident.
They happen because:

✓ Phase 1 proved safety
✓ Phase 2 showed efficacy
✓ Regulators said "keep going"
✓ Patients showed improvement

87 therapies in Phase 3 means:
87 potential cures in the pipeline

The revolution isn't coming.
It's already in the final stages.
```

### QUESTION TO USER (cyan box):
```
🤔 87 therapies approaching approval...

That could change millions of lives.
